# ESP32-CAM_V1.6_V1.9_MB
* ESP32-CAM-MB, base module design, schematic,  
* [ESP32-CAM V1.6 modification to uses external RESET pin and the auto download](https://github.com/xiaolaba/ESP32-CAM_V1.6_V1.9_MB/blob/main/README.md#ai-thinker-esp32-cam-no-exposed-reset-pin)  
* ESP32-CAM V1.6 modification, more stable,  
* upgrade to ESP32-CAM V1.9.  

looks like V1.6 is the same as V1.9, really ?

### Ai-thinker ESP32-CAM, no exposed RESET pin  
either clone or the original design, ESP32-S module pin3 = RESET, only connected to RST button, no external assessment pin. not so user friendly, so it was workaround to solder a wire for the purpose. It was selling without USB-UART chip, either no the ESP32-CAM-MB bundled. The ESP32 core is V1, vulnerable to rom dump.

### ESP32-CAM V1.9, selling with ESP32-CAM-MB bundled  
a new version, slightly modified design, RESET pin connected to one spare GND pin, 2 more resistors included, we may call ESP32-CAM V1.9. The ESP32 core is V3, but metal can is identical laser marking of ESP32-S & FCC ID. there is no schematic, but a hand written copy is obtained.

the complete package selling in year 2023, ESP32-CAM V1.9, and the ESP32-CAM-MB, one of clone or variants, only USB-UART chip CH340C and 3.3V LDO.

### ESP32-CAM V1.6, how to upgrade to V1.9 to uses with ESP32-CAM-MB
see green-rectangle, to cut the PCB trace, isolate the GND connection, solder a wire from ESP32-S reset point to the pinhead.  
see blue-rectangle, two more resistors (4 pads, 2-empty, 2 used, 0 ohm jumper-resistor to select GND or RESET, the funcitonal) in contrast to V1.6

### ESP32-CAM V1.6, how to upgrade by yourself and more reliable  
ESP32-S core, V1 and V3, current hungry is a noticeable difference, the same ESP32-CAM-MB used. ESP-CAM V1.6 is constanly halt during opeation, 1117 LDO supply 3.3V to the SoC, input terminal has no any buffer capacitor, the designer was saving few cents but many of the users had been suffering strange problem like no download, instability etc., by adding a 22uF/10 capacitor to the LDO input, it works like a charm, problem solved.
